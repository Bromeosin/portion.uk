# Portion

So this is a pretty basic WP theme with some simple requirements that will get the job done in the meantime before I need think about writing something completely custom. It just needs ACF installed correctly and fields for that will be attached into the REPO for easy access. 

As this is a public REPO some things will be held back obviously... I should remember to do that...
